Anything you type in normal mode is a command.

To enter insert mode, type "i" while in normal mode.

To leave insert mode, press Escape.

To enter line mode, type ":" while in normal mode.

After a command completes in line mode you are returned to normal mode.

You can also leave command mode by pressing Escape.

Now you're editing!
